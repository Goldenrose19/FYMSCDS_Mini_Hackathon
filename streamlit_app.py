st.write('Like the redness of the East, the first ray of the sun, You are just like that, a reason for joy. Hidden in your name is a new beginning, Your friendship is like a pleasant morning breeze.May this whole world light up with your smile, May you take step after step on the path of your dreams. Prachi, your existence is like a drop of dew, Just your presence gives the mind a rest, a shelter.Keep smiling always, keep blooming like a flower, Keep shining like a star in the sky of life.All the best for your tommorows exam!!')
